//! `goal-state` — shared goal state for the pi-goal port.
//!
//! A goal is a long-running task that the agent pursues across
//! multiple turns. Goal state persists in the session directory as
//! one file **per goal**, named by the goal's id: `goal-<id>.json`.
//! A small pointer file, `goal.json` (`{"current_goal": "<id>"}`),
//! names which per-goal file is the session's current goal. Past
//! goals are never overwritten: their files stay in the session
//! directory as traces, and only the pointer moves.
//!
//! Tools and hooks read and write these files through
//! [`GoalState::load`] / [`GoalState::save`] to coordinate.
//!
//! See `docs/pi-goal-readiness.md` for the full port plan and
//! `docs/goal-ux.md` for the user-driven goal flow: the goal is set
//! by the user (TUI extension writes the goal files), the
//! `model.before` hook injects a single cache-stable goal block from
//! the current goal file on every model call, and the `run.idle`
//! hook keeps the loop going until the goal is completed, blocked,
//! paused, or cleared.
